=head1 NAME

ack - grep-like text finder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ack [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
    ack -f [options] [DIRECTORY...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ack is designed as a replacement for F<grep>.

Ack searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are
named, or the file name - is given) for lines containing a match to the
given PATTERN.  By default, ack prints the matching lines.

Ack can also list files that would be searched, without actually searching
them, to let you take advantage of ack's file-type filtering capabilities.

=head1 FILE SELECTION

I<ack> is intelligent about the files it searches.  It knows about
certain file types, based on both the extension on the file and,
in some cases, the contents of the file.  These selections can be
made with the B<--type> option.

With no file selections, I<ack> only searches files of types that
it recognizes.  If you have a file called F<foo.wango>, and I<ack>
doesn't know what a .wango file is, I<ack> won't search it.

The B<-a> option tells I<ack> to select all files, regardless of
type.

Some files will never be selected by I<ack>, even with B<-a>,
including:

=over 4

=item * Backup files: Files ending with F<~>, or F<#*#>

=item * Coredumps: Files matching F<core.\d+>

=back

=head1 DIRECTORY SELECTION

I<ack> descends through the directory tree of the starting directories
specified.  However, it will ignore the shadow directories used by
many version control systems, and the build directories used by the
Perl MakeMaker system.

The following directories will never be descended into: F<_darcs>,
F<CVS>, F<RCS>, F<SCCS>, F<.svn>, F<blib>, F<.git>

=head1 WHEN TO USE GREP

I<ack> trumps I<grep> as an everyday tool 99% of the time, but don't
throw I<grep> away, because there are times you'll still need it.

I<ack> only searches through files of types that it recognizes.  If
it can't tell what type a file is, then it won't look.  If that's
annoying to you, use I<grep>.

If you truly want to search every file and every directory, I<ack>
won't do it.  You'll need to rely on I<grep>.

If you need context around your matches, use I<grep>, but check
back in on I<ack> in the near future, because I'm adding it.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-a>, B<--all>

Operate on all files, regardless of type (but still skip directories
like F<blib>, F<CVS>, etc.)

=item B<-c>, B<--count>

Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for
each input file.  If B<-l> is in effect, it will only show the
number of lines for each file that has lines matching.  Without
B<-l>, some line counts may be zeroes.

=item B<--color>, B<--nocolor>

B<--color> highlights the matching text.  B<--nocolor> supresses
the color.  This is on by default unless the output is redirected,
or running under Windows.

=item B<-f>

Only print the files that would be searched, without actually doing
any searching.  PATTERN must not be specified, or it will be taken as
a path to search.

=item B<--follow>, B<--nofollow>

Follow or don't follow symlinks, other than whatever starting files
or directories were specified on the command line.

This is off by default.

=item B<-g=I<REGEX>>

Same as B<-f>, but only print files that match I<REGEX>.  The entire
path and filename are matched against I<REGEX>, and I<REGEX> is a
Perl regular expression, not a shell glob.

=item B<--group>, B<--nogroup>

B<--group> groups matches by file name with.  This is the default when
used interactively.

B<--nogroup> prints one result per line, like grep.  This is the default
when output is redirected.

=item B<-H>, B<--with-filename>

Print the filename for each match.

=item B<-h>, B<--no-filename>

Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are
searched.

=item B<--help>

Print a short help statement.

=item B<-i>, B<--ignore-case>

Ignore case in the search strings.

=item B<-l>, B<--files-with-matches>

Only print the filenames of matching files, instead of the matching text.

=item B<-m=I<NUM>>, B<--max-count=I<NUM>>

Stop reading a file after I<NUM> matches.

=item B<--man>

Print this manual page.

=item B<-n>

No descending into subdirectories.

=item B<-o>

Show only the part of each line matching PATTERN (turns off text
highlighting)

=item B<--output=I<expr>>

Output the evaluation of I<expr> for each line (turns off text
highlighting)

=item B<--passthru>

Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression.  Highlighting
will still work, though, so it can be used to highlight matches while
still seeing the entire file, as in:

    # Watch a log file, and highlight a certain IP address
    $ tail -f ~/access.log | ack --passthru 123.45.67.89

=item B<-Q>, B<--literal>

Quote all metacharacters.  PATTERN is treated as a literal.

=item B<--sort-files>

Sorts the found files lexically.  Use this if you want your file
listings to be deterministic between runs of I<ack>.

=item B<--thpppt>

Display the all-important Bill The Cat logo.  Note that the exact
spelling of B<--thpppppt> is not important.  It's checked against
a regular expression.

=item B<--type=TYPE>, B<--type=noTYPE>

Specify the types of files to include or exclude from a search.
TYPE is a filetype, like I<perl> or I<xml>.  B<--type=perl> can
also be specified as B<--perl>, and B<--type=noperl> can be done
as B<--noperl>.

If a file is of both type "foo" and "bar", specifying --foo and
--nobar will exclude the file, because an exclusion takes precedence
over an inclusion.

Type specifications can be repeated and are ORed together.

See I<ack --help=types> for a list of valid types.

=item B<-v>, B<--invert-match>

Invert match: select non-matching lines

=item B<--version>

Display version and copyright information.

=item B<-w>, B<--word-regexp>

Force PATTERN to match only whole words.  The PATTERN is wrapped with
C<\b> metacharacters.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item ACK_OPTIONS

This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of
any explicit options on the command line.

=item ACK_COLOR_FILENAME

Specifies the color of the filename when it's printed in B<--group>
mode.  By default, it's "bold green".

The recognized attributes are clear, reset, dark, bold, underline,
underscore, blink, reverse, concealed black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, on_black, on_red, on_green, on_yellow, on_blue,
on_magenta, on_cyan, and on_white.  Case is not significant.
Underline and underscore are equivalent, as are clear and reset.
The color alone sets the foreground color, and on_color sets the
background color.

=item ACK_COLOR_MATCH

Specifies the color of the matching text when printed in B<--color>
mode.  By default, it's "black on_yellow".

See B<ACK_COLOR_FILENAME> for the color specifications.

=back

=head1 ACK & OTHER TOOLS

=head2 Vim integration

F<ack> integrates easily with the Vim text editor. Set this in your
F<.vimrc> to use F<ack> instead of F<grep>:

    set grepprg=ack\ -a

That examples uses C<-a> to search through all files, but you may
use other default flags. Now you can search with F<ack> and easily
step through the results in Vim:

  :grep Dumper perllib

=cut

=head1 GOTCHAS

Note that FILES must still match valid selection rules.  For example,

    ack something --perl foo.rb

will search nothing, because I<foo.rb> is a Ruby file.
